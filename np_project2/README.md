# Project2
This project is to build 3 kinds of servers:
1. Design a Concurrent connection-oriented server. This server allows one client connect to it.
2. Design a server of the chat-like systems, called remote working systems (rwg). In this system, users can communicate with other users. You need to use the single-process concurrent paradigm to design this server.
3. Design the rwg server using the concurrent connection-oriented paradigm with shared memory and FIFO.
